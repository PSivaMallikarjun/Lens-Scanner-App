Image Upload & OCR:

Users can upload an image containing text.
The app processes the image using Tesseract.js, an OCR library, to extract text.
Interactive Text Features:

Copy Text: Copy the extracted text to the clipboard for easy reuse.
Text-to-Speech: Listen to the extracted text using the browser's speech synthesis API.
Search: Search for specific words within the extracted text.
Responsive Design:

A simple, user-friendly interface ensures ease of interaction.
Canvas Rendering:

The uploaded image is displayed on a canvas element for visual confirmation.
